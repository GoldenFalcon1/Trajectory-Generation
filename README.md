# Quintic Polynomial Solver
In this exercise you will implement a quintic polynomial solver. This will let you take boundary conditions as input and generate a polynomial trajectory which matches those conditions with minimal jerk.

Inputs
Your solver will take three inputs.

start - [si, sii, siii]
end - [sf, sff, sfff]
T - The duration of maneuver in seconds.

# What to do 
Implement the JMT(start, end, T) function in main.cpp
